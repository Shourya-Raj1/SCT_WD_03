# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe - SkillCraft Technology Task 03

A modern, responsive, and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe web application featuring both local multiplayer and an intelligent computer opponent. Developed as part of my **Web Development Internship** at **SkillCraft Technology**.

## 🌟 Features

* **Dual Game Modes**:
* **Player vs Player**: Classic local multiplayer experience.
* **Player vs Computer**: Challenge an AI that prioritizes winning moves and strategic blocking.


* **Real-time Score Tracking**: Keeps track of wins for Player X, Player O, and total ties across sessions.
* **Fully Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* **Interactive UI/UX**: Includes smooth animations for moves, winner highlights, and hover effects.
* **State Management**: Dynamic game status updates (e.g., "Player X's Turn", "Computer's Turn...").

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the game board and controls.
* **CSS3**:
* Custom animations (`popIn`, `pulse`, `slideIn`).
* Glassmorphism-inspired UI with linear gradients.
* Media queries for mobile responsiveness.


* **JavaScript (ES6+)**:
* Game logic and win-condition validation.
* Basic AI implementation for computer moves.
* DOM manipulation for real-time updates.
